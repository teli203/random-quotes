## 🌟 Random Quotes App 🌟 

" " [Random Quotes App](https://random-quotes-neon.vercel.app/) " " 


The Random Quotes App allows users to effortlessly generate random quotes along with their authors. You can also share a quote directly to your Twitter account by clicking the Tweet button and signing in.

Due to the way the API is accessed, some browsers may block the quotes from loading. A warning is displayed on the app that reads:
"Having trouble seeing quotes due to security browser settings? <a href='https://api.quotable.io/random' target='_blank'>Tap here to authorize</a> the quote API on your device."

When you tap the "Tap here to authorize" link, you may receive a security warning asking whether you want to proceed. Select yes to view the site — this will resolve the issue, and a quote should then appear. You can then choose to tweet the quote or generate a new one.

The API used was created by Luke Peavey and is available at:
git@github.com:lukePeavey/quotable.git.
Quotable is a free, open-source quotations API originally developed as part of a FreeCodeCamp project. It has since become a valuable resource for web developers learning to work with APIs.
